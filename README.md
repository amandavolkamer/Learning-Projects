## Note
The files in this repository are too large to view directly on GitHub, so you will need to download them to view. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to Power BI for direct editing, but the reports can still be explored by downloading the respective `.pbix` files.

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out with any questions or feedback!
